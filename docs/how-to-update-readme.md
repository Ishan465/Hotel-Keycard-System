# Updating the README.md File

1. **Open the README.md File in Visual Studio Code**
   - In the Explorer panel on the left side, click on the `README.md` file to open it.

2. **Update the Formatting Badge**
   - In the first few lines of the `README.md` file, you'll see a URL that looks like this: `https://github.com/cambrian-iot/iot1001-assignment-template/actions/workflows/formatting.yml`
   - Replace `cambrian-iot/iot1001-assignment-template` with your GitHub username and repository name. The URL should now look like this: `https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repository>/actions/workflows/formatting.yml`
   - Do the same for the second URL in the `img src` tag.

3. **Add Your Output Image (if required)**
   - Run your code and take a screenshot of the output. Name the screenshot `output.PNG`.
   - Move the screenshot to the `docs` directory in your repository and overwrite the existing image if there is one.

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Save your changes in Visual Studio Code.
   - Open the Source Control panel (click the Git icon in the left sidebar).
   - Stage your changes by clicking the "+" icon next to `README.md` in the Changes list.
   - Enter a commit message in the "Message" box. This message should briefly describe the changes you made.
   - Click the checkmark icon at the top of the Source Control panel to commit your changes.

5. **Push Your Changes**
   - Click the "..." icon at the top of the Source Control panel and select "Push" to push your changes to your GitHub repository.

6. **Check Your Changes**
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - You should see your updated `README.md` file displayed under your repository files. Check that your project description, formatting badge, and output image are displaying correctly.
